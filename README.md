# BetterTODO
This is a better todo that I've been working on which is built on pure javascript.

You can create new list and and tasks to that specific list only.

You can Add, delete, update the tasks.

App is divided into three files
  1. index.html
  2. style.css
  3. script.js
  
  
  script.js is divided into 3 parts. constants, eventlisteners and functions.
